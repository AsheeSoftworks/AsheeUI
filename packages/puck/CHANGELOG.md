# @asheeui/puck

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- The Puck integration moves out of `@asheeui/web` into a package of its own, routed by
  platform the way the umbrella is.
  
  **`@asheeui/puck`** is new. It has one entry point and two branches, resolved from the
  manifest rather than at runtime: the web branch is the editor's block registry
  (`asheePuckConfig`), the editor's page renderer and the fields a builder fills in, and the
  native branch is the same block specs plus a renderer that draws a stored page with
  `@asheeui/native`. The specs — the label a builder shows, the fields it fills in, the
  value each block starts as — live once in a shared layer that imports no renderer and
  nothing from `@puckeditor/core`, which is what keeps the editor an optional peer the web
  branch alone needs and lets a native bundle reach the package at all. `PuckPage` renders a
  stored page: the editor's own `Render` on the web, the native walker on a device.
  
  **`@asheeui/web`** loses the `./puck` subpath, its `@puckeditor/core` peer dependency and
  its Puck build entry. It gains two things. `@asheeui/web/section-kit` exposes the heading
  and action-row helpers the Puck blocks compose with; the kit stays off the main entry, as
  before. And the package now exports `useAsheeConfig`, `useAshee` and `AsheeConfigContext`,
  which the Puck page shell reads to tell whether an application already provided a
  configuration before it renders one of its own. No component, prop or configuration key
  changes.
  
  **`@asheeui/native`** gains `@asheeui/native/section-kit` for the same reason.
  
  **`@asheeui/ui`** drops its `@puckeditor/core` optional peer. The umbrella never exported
  the Puck integration, so the entry described a dependency no import of the umbrella could
  reach; the package that does export it declares it now.
  
  `@asheeui/web/puck` was created in the same unreleased work this changeset is part of, so
  no consumer can have depended on it and no deprecation window applies: the migration is
  `asheeui/puck` → `@asheeui/puck`. [Migration](../docs/migration.md),
  [Puck](../docs/puck.md) and [Native](../docs/native.md) record the change, and decision
  0024 states why.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- The Puck integration moves out of `@asheeui/web` into a package of its own. One entry
  point, two renderers: on the web the package is the editor's block registry, the
  editor's page renderer and the fields a builder fills in; on React Native it is the
  same specs and a renderer that draws a stored page with the native components. An
  application that composes pages on the web and shows them on a device imports one
  package and writes one set of specifiers.

  `@puckeditor/core` is an optional peer: it is needed by the web half alone, and the
  native half loads without it.
